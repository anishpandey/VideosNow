   @brief VocService encapsulates the functionality provided by Voc SDK.

   @discussion VocService instance is created through VocServiceFactory.
   To create the service, a delegate implementing VocServiceDelegate protocol and delegate queue are required. In most cases the delegate queue will be the main app queue, however there is no restriction what type of queue to use. If the queue is not serial then users of Voc SDK must ensure voc item objects are accessed serially since they are not thread safe. One such way to achieve that would be to add a lock object of some kind to voc item userInfo and use it to serialize access.

   VocService state is available through VocService.state property. Initially VocService is in VOCServiceStateNotRegistered state until it is successfully registered with VoC server. To register call [VocService registerService].

   VocService might become unregistered and return to VOCServiceStateNotRegistered state if the user is deleted from server or some time has passed since SDK could connect to VoC server.
