/*!
 @brief Load items with given content ids and source.

 @discussion Returns a VocItemSet that contains items that matches the given set of content unique id and source. The SDK searches the item locally and returns VocItemSet with those items. The method also initiates a lookup in PCD Server if not found locally. content_unique_id is the content identifier provided to PCD Server while ingesting a content item and this id can be accessed from VocItem::contentId. content_provider_id is the source identifier provided to PCD Server while ingesting an item and this information can be accessed from VocItem::source. It is the combination of content_unique_id and content_provider_id that makes a VocItem unique. This API method returns an VocItemSet based on the contentId set provided. contentId is unique to a source but multiple source can have same contentId. Eventhough source is marked optional, it is highly recommended to provide source particularly when the client has access to multiple source. All the contentId in the contentIds must belong to same source. This API method will first search the VocItem locally and if not found, it will search in the PCD Server. This method is asynchronous and completion block will be invoked on delegate queue. If items.count < contentIds.count, the completion block will return non nil itemSet.items and non nil error. SDK will return the partial result in this case and provide more information on the items that are not available locally. This method is safe to be called on any thread. Completion is always called on delegate queue.

 @param contentIds is a set of item contentIds (@see VocItem::contentId).
 @param sourceName is the source name which all the item contentId belongs. (@see VocItem::source)
 @param completion The completion block that returns the VocItemSet and the error.
